# Sixto Portal

Client-facing project portal for **Erick Sixto | Salesforce Specialist**.

Built with [Emergent](https://emergent.sh), backed by Notion as the single source of truth.

---

## What This Is

A professional client portal that reads project data from Notion and presents it to clients. Clients can view project progress, tasks, deliverables, invoices, meetings, and submit feedback — all driven by data already managed in Notion.

## Architecture

```

```

**Notion** is the operating system — all project, client, task, invoice, and deliverable data lives there.

**Emergent** renders the portal UI from Notion data via the Notion API.

**Stripe** handles invoicing. Zapier syncs invoice events back to Notion.
